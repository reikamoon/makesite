Let me introduce myself
You didn't think I was done, did ya?
Well, I just begun having my fun, baby
Some people live for attention
Playing the victim
But baby, I was born to do the killing
I see how you're going crazy
Always thinking 'bout me, baby, on the daily
Feed me your negativity
Talk some more about me
I know that you love me, love me
Funny how you think I'm bothered
Know I'm nothing like the others
You shouldn't have messed with me
'Cause I heard that you're afraid of
Monsters, monsters
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
You ain't ready for the monster, monster
I'm just being me
Cut out the things that I don't need
And I don't care if you disagree
I don't need no sympathy
Winning the game on my own
Yeah, baby
I see how you're going crazy
Always thinking 'bout me, baby, on the daily
Feed me your negativity
Talk some more about me
I know that you love me, love me
Funny how you think I'm bothered
Know I'm nothing like the others
You shouldn't have messed with me
'Cause I heard that you're afraid of
Monsters, monsters
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
You ain't ready for the monster, monster
Ah, it could've been so different between us
But then you went and messed everything up
You took a knife and stabbed me in the back
Took everything I had
Went to your friends and laughed
This is the last time I'm gonna tell you now
If you try to break me, I'm gonna burn you down
Baby, I'm done with you, not coming back for you
It's funny how you think I'm bothered
Know I'm nothing like the others
You shouldn't have messed with me
'Cause I heard that you're afraid of
Monsters, monsters
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
You ain't ready for the monster, monster
