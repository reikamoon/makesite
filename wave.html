  <p>WAVE</p>

<p>My anxiety, it’s all ending me
still the lights are blaring green I keep on going</p>

<p>Soaring high, then fall from the sky
as the cycle never ends</p>

<p>heart and souls are connecting
from the lies we know as fantasies
but is all worth correcting
its romance that’ll never be
keep on dancing through the dark</p>

<p>feel the moon is glowing bright
and it’s wrapping me so tight
I can feel the pounding reverberation going off in my body</p>

<p>Its no longer worth contemplating
I don’t feel afraid of anything
and I radiate as I feel my heart it’s finally coming back to start
its twirling and whirling the world is a-</p>

<p>When I try and think, get my minds in sync
all the light are blaring red, I keep on going
let me be, I just wanna flee
and just make my get away</p>

<p>opening a new window,
like I’m skyping with an alien
these fairy tales I can’t let go
it’s a romance feuled adrenalin
ah, can’t keep sleeping in the dark?</p>

<p>feel the moon is glowing bright
and it’s wrapping me so tight
I can feel the pounding reverberation going off in me again</p>

<p>it’s no use for me too keep running
just forget the reason Im struggling
all that matters is I can feel my heart it’s finally coming back to start</p>

<p>it’s coming, and flooding my future’s a</p>

<p>ah, dreaming, dancing through the dark</p>

<p>I can hear tomorrow’s cry
asking me to come alive
and I see the hate as its painted over everything I’ve torn apart</p>

<p>now I filed with determinations
it’s no use stopping this sensation
I can feel it all deep inside my heart it’s finally coming back to start</p>

<p>its twirling and whirling the world’s be come a
watching non stopping tomorrow’s here</p>
