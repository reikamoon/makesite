WAVE

My anxiety, it’s all ending me
still the lights are blaring green I keep on going

Soaring high, then fall from the sky
as the cycle never ends

heart and souls are connecting
from the lies we know as fantasies
but is all worth correcting
its romance that’ll never be
keep on dancing through the dark

feel the moon is glowing bright
and it’s wrapping me so tight
I can feel the pounding reverberation going off in my body

Its no longer worth contemplating
I don’t feel afraid of anything
and I radiate as I feel my heart it’s finally coming back to start
its twirling and whirling the world is a-

When I try and think, get my minds in sync
all the light are blaring red, I keep on going
let me be, I just wanna flee
and just make my get away

opening a new window,
like I’m skyping with an alien
these fairy tales I can’t let go
it’s a romance feuled adrenalin
ah, can’t keep sleeping in the dark?

feel the moon is glowing bright
and it’s wrapping me so tight
I can feel the pounding reverberation going off in me again

it’s no use for me too keep running
just forget the reason Im struggling
all that matters is I can feel my heart it’s finally coming back to start

it’s coming, and flooding my future’s a

ah, dreaming, dancing through the dark

I can hear tomorrow’s cry
asking me to come alive
and I see the hate as its painted over everything I’ve torn apart

now I filed with determinations
it’s no use stopping this sensation
I can feel it all deep inside my heart it’s finally coming back to start

its twirling and whirling the world’s be come a
watching non stopping tomorrow’s here
