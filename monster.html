  <p>Let me introduce myself
You didn&rsquo;t think I was done, did ya?
Well, I just begun having my fun, baby
Some people live for attention
Playing the victim
But baby, I was born to do the killing
I see how you&rsquo;re going crazy
Always thinking &lsquo;bout me, baby, on the daily
Feed me your negativity
Talk some more about me
I know that you love me, love me
Funny how you think I&rsquo;m bothered
Know I&rsquo;m nothing like the others
You shouldn&rsquo;t have messed with me
&lsquo;Cause I heard that you&rsquo;re afraid of
Monsters, monsters
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
You ain&rsquo;t ready for the monster, monster
I&rsquo;m just being me
Cut out the things that I don&rsquo;t need
And I don&rsquo;t care if you disagree
I don&rsquo;t need no sympathy
Winning the game on my own
Yeah, baby
I see how you&rsquo;re going crazy
Always thinking &lsquo;bout me, baby, on the daily
Feed me your negativity
Talk some more about me
I know that you love me, love me
Funny how you think I&rsquo;m bothered
Know I&rsquo;m nothing like the others
You shouldn&rsquo;t have messed with me
&lsquo;Cause I heard that you&rsquo;re afraid of
Monsters, monsters
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
You ain&rsquo;t ready for the monster, monster
Ah, it could&rsquo;ve been so different between us
But then you went and messed everything up
You took a knife and stabbed me in the back
Took everything I had
Went to your friends and laughed
This is the last time I&rsquo;m gonna tell you now
If you try to break me, I&rsquo;m gonna burn you down
Baby, I&rsquo;m done with you, not coming back for you
It&rsquo;s funny how you think I&rsquo;m bothered
Know I&rsquo;m nothing like the others
You shouldn&rsquo;t have messed with me
&lsquo;Cause I heard that you&rsquo;re afraid of
Monsters, monsters
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
Are you ready for the monster, monster?
You ain&rsquo;t ready for the monster, monster</p>
